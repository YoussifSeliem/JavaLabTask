# JavaLabTask
In this repo there are five tasks to be submitted
> the first two tasks : nPr, nCr and ascii to char are submitted in the lab

Each directory represents a task the source code of each task in the "src" directory inside the directory representing the task

## Circle_Triangle 
* In this task there are two classes: one for a circle and one for a triangle
* The both classes have all methods and attributes to help calculating area, circumferance and the dimensions of the shape also

## Quick Sort
* One of the most powerful sorting algorithm
* Implemented using divide and conquer methodology to get the array sorted
* At beginning one element of the array is choosen as a pivot
* During the operation the elements smaller than the pivot are moved to its left and the elements larger than the pivot are moved to its right
* This doesnot mean that the elements in the left and the elements in the right are sorted
* So a recursive call appears by doing the same function on the left part and the right part
* This process is done until the size of the array in the recursive call equals one (base case)
* Then we will get the array sorted

## matTranspose
* This is a simple program of getting a matrix from the user then output its transpose
> The transpose of the matrix if the same matrix after exchanging its dimensions and exchanging the rows with columns

## mxElement
* This is a simple program of getting largest element of the array elements

## removeCommas
* In this program we get a string from the user, then we print on the screen the same string after removing all commas

## circleCylinderSheet6Q2
* In this program we have class Circle with attributes color and radius.
* we also have Cylinder with attribute height and Cylinder extends cirle so inherting color and radius
* Circle contains setters, getters , getArea and toString methods
* Cylinder inherites all of these and have also getVolume method
